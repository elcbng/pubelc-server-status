# How does the main page work

There is a prepared default node configuration file before deploy. While the page loading, it will try to connect to the default node to get more dynamic data including more node configuration. Usually, the configuration file is a url.
To avoid all of our node offline which will affect the page can't connect to any node, we configure github.com as our default node. So the configuration file is not just a url. 

Once the page connected to a node, it will get the node information file first to verify there is a pairs back-end running. After verification the page will convert charts through the last part of file.

While page loaded, it would begin to get data from nodes and tansform the data from string to lines
